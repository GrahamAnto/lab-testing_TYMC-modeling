# lab-testing_TYMC-modeling
From the publication "Regional (in)Consistency and Comparability of Cannabis Laboratory Testing: A Statistical Exploration of Total Yeast and Mold " by Antoszewski, Carrasco, Glaros, and Slade. This repository is a container for the statistical overdispersion models and state TYM lab counts used in the publication, detailing the methodology and analysis of overdispersion models, particularly the lognormal distribution, being well-suited to characterize TYM contamination in cannabis lab sampling in state markets. Data files and jupyter notebook are included to run analysis.

Questions or requests for more information on methodology or model validation, please contact: graham.antoszewski@gmail.com
