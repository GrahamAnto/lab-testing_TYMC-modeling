# lab-testing_TYMC-modeling
From the publication "Regional (in)Consistency and Comparability of Cannabis Laboratory Testing: A Statistical Exploration of Total Yeast and Mold " by Antoszewski, Carrasco, Glaros, and Slade. This repository is a container for the statistical overdispersion models and state TYM lab counts used in the publication; For the purpspe of replicability and accountability, these documents provide providee further detail on the methodology of overdispersion models, particularly the lognormal distribution, to characterize TYM contamination in cannabis lab sampling of state flower products (MA, MD, NJ, NV, RI). Data files and jupyter notebook are included to run analysis.

Questions or requests for more information on methodology or model validation, please contact: graham.antoszewski@gmail.com
